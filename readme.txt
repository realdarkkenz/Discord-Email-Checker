1: Add the emails to the emails.txt file, it will be without password. For example: galaxymarket123@gmail.com, it will be just an email.
2: Run Main.py and wait for it to check. After it is finished, it will save the running Discord Account Emails in livehesap.txt

Note: It will time out after 200-300 checks, so use VPN, proxy system will be added soon.
